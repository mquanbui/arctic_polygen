# If you compiled MSTK with parallel support, use mpicc and mpiCC as
# your C and C++ compilers so that the right MPI includes and libraries
# are found
#
# Unless your MSTK installation specifically excluded ExodusII support,

# Use CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release" for optimized code and
#                            ="Debug" for debug code
#                            ="RelWithDebugInfo" for optimized code with debug symbols

#
# Set "USE_DEBUG_MSTK_LIBS" to "yes" along with "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE" to "Debug"
# to debug both the project and the underlying MSTK libraries. If you use this
# option, you must build MSTK with "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE" equal to "Debug"
# If this parameter is not specified, the optimized MSTK libraries are used
# Similarly, set "USE_DEBUG_MCGEOM_LIBS" to "yes" to debug the underlying
# MCGeom libraries.

#
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX indicates the top level directory for the installation
# the project executable or library and include files
#
# if APPEND_ARCHOS_TO_INSTALLPATH=yes, then ARCHOS will be appended to 
# install paths of libraries and executables (e.g. executables will be
